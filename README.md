## Data Set

I used commonly used datasets for the development of sentiment analyzers. The FER-2013 Faces Database. They are approximately 29000 image data, 48x48 size and classified into seven emotions. But One emotion, disgust, has not enough images so I decided to exclude it and train AI. This is because I heard that imbalance in datasets affects accuracy.
However, We go through the pre-process of resizing and arranging data for easy learning. Furthermore, image augmentation (zoom_range = 0.2, horizontal_flip=True, shear_range=0.2) is applied so that arbitrary data can be clearly classified.

## Face Detection


I used OpenCV library to recognize faces. I just added a little code to extract the face coordinates.
